# ======================= Relation Extraction (Simplified for Mistral) =======================

Extract relationships between entities from the text below.

Each relationship should be a JSON object like this:
{
  "source": "<entity 1>",
  "target": "<entity 2>",
  "relation": "<type of relation>",
  "evidence": "<sentence or phrase that supports this relation>",
  "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>
}

Return ONLY a JSON array. Do not include commentary.

Text:
{input_text}
